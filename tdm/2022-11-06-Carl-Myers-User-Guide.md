# Carl Myers User Guide

This is the definitive guide for how to operate a Carl Myers, written by a Carl Myers himself.

As a team member and people manager, I find it is often helpful to communicate to others how I best work so they can work together with me efficiently. I also encourage others to do the same for me so I can work well with them and do my best to understand and accomodate their preferences.

## Summary

I am an honest, nerdy, neurodiverse, data-driven, analytical, idealistic, empathetic, and most of all (like most humans) deeply flawed individual. I have wanted to work with computers since I was six years old and I haven't gotten tired or bored of them yet. I have a deep interest in science fiction as well as science fact, epistemology, classical music, philosophy, tabletop gaming, and making the world a better place. At first I thought I would never become a manager, until the day I realized I already was (in all but name) and my team needed me. I used to live by the motto "I tell computers what to do for a living". Now, I think it is more accurate to say, "I help people to tell computers what to do for a living". Like any good problem in our field, the solution was in fact, an extra layer of indirection.

## What I Believe about Life

* It is important to have strong beliefs, weakly held, and revise them in the face of new evidence
* There are objective facts about reality we might discover by analyzing the evidence
* The purpose of life is what you give it - and I have given mine the goal of making my tiny corner of the world a better place
* Honesty is morally required in nearly every situation you or I will ever find ourselves in, even with respect to lies of omission and how Steve's wife looks in that dress
* The golden rule (treat others how you wish to be treated) is *inferior* to the platinum rule (treat others how *they* wish to be treated)
* The needs of the many outweighs the needs of the few, or the one

## What I Believe about People Management

* A manager's job is to say "my team did this" when the team succeeds, and "I failed my team" when the team does not succeed
* Failure *is* an option, as long as you learn from it
* Trust is an absolute requirement to be an effective manager - in both directions - and must be earned
* One of the worst failures a manager can make is to deliver a suprising preformance evaluation, reports should always know where they stand
* Always assume good intent - the only times you'll be wrong were going to be a bad time anyways
* Sometimes a leader has information they must keep in confidence, which seems to contradict the honesty thing above - I will never lie, but I will say "I'm not at liberty to discuss that at this time" - which would be true
* You cannot effectively guide or influence people without understanding their goals and motivations
* If you can align your goals with others, then you will always be on the same team
* You can't be successful without genuine empathy and a vested interest in your reports' success
* The best way for me to grow as a leader is to encourage everyone I work with to give me critical feedback, both positive and negative, as shortly after the observed behavior as possible and without fear for my feelings or bias

## How I Prefer to Communicate

* I prefer asynchronous communication to synchronous, easily searchable to opaque, and written to video/sound - I prefer slack to email, and a phone call only if it is time critical and I don't reply immediately
* My memory is imperfect and augmented by technology, so organizing information for easier search and retrieval is immensely helpful - it also helps you because you can reference the information later
* I will in general prefer more communication rather than less, and will tell you if the detail or question asking is too much
* I will always appreciate a gentle reminder and will never be annoyed if it reasonably seems like I may have overlooked something

## Advice for the Humans With Whom I Must Interoperate

* I am not always good at multitasking, so allowing me to serialize or complete a task or topic before moving on to the next is preferred
* I prefer to understand how to derive an answer, rather than to memorize it
* I can be easily distracted sometimes, but I am working on it - please do not take offense if I ask you to repeat a question

## What am I passionate about?

* Build systems and build engineering - systems that feature atomic commits, dependency management, and bit-for-bit reproducibility
* Source control in general and Git in particular
* Tools that empower deveopers to experiment and deliver value quickly and safely

## What are my goals?

* Having recently transitioned from SWE3 (Staff Engineer) to TDM3 (Software Engineering Manager), I am focused on becoming the best manager I can be while maintaining my technical chops
* Eventually, I might like to become a TDM4 (Sr. Manager, manager-of-managers), but I have a lot of growth in front of me to focus on first
* I want to bring big impact to my current employer by helping deliver the excellent tools and processes I've learned about at other highy successful software shops
* I want to communicate for our industry as a whole to increase familiarity with these solutions which, until very recently, have mostly been proprietary and for which there are only limited solutions freely available

## Conclusion

It is abundantly clear that I am, first and formost, a human. Each human is unique and we all have our quirks. If you are reading this, I hope to be a very good and reliable human that might meet your requirements and hopefully even exceed your expectations.
